I would like to ask the Senator to support Senator Rand Paul's "Justice for Breonna Taylor Act." Law enforcement officers have abused no-knock warrants for far too long, with deadly consequences. Breonna Taylor was KILLED in her own home because her boyfriend dared to defend himself from someone who knocked down his door with a battering ram. Because of the no-knock warrant, he had no way to know that the people knocking down his door were police officers. These warrants must end, for the safety of our law enforcement, and for the safety of the community that they have sworn to protect and serve.
