I would like to ask Representative <insert name> to support and co-sponsor Representative Justin Amash's bill, "Ending Qualified Immunity Act." Americans deserve a justice system that gives them justice when law enforcement officers harm, and in some cases, unconstitutionally kill those that they have sworn to protect and serve. Removing the roadblocks that stand between victims and justice through the courts is the best way to advance the cause of accountable government, and liberty for those who live under it. We must stand against this judicial activism to make this happen.

Please let me know what he intends to do about this legislation.

Thanks.
